# Requesting a quota increase<a name="request-quota-increase"></a>

For adjustable quotas, you can request a quota increase\. Smaller increases are automatically approved, and larger requests are submitted to AWS Support\. You can track your request case in the AWS Support console\. Requests to increase service quotas do not receive priority support\. If you have an urgent request, contact AWS Support\.
